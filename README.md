# skeleton
I will set up the basic structure of my file, using Jeffrey Way's skeleton from PHP Practicioners and Toby Versteeg's skeleton from CodeGorilla as examples. Toby's skeleton looks different, for instance the database connection seems to be made in Libraries MySql.php and not in Database Connection.php. I might use Toby's skeleton to add in extra functionality, like Migrate. That code is far above my paygrade right now but during testing it is very handy to migrate database (seeding structure and content, building it up again). For now I just leave it. Next step: setting up my routes, controllers and views.
