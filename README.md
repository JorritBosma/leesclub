# leesclub
A website to keep track of books you have read and books you want to read.
You can also check out what other users are reading and start a conversation in the comment section.
The wireframe is available at https://octopus.do/yxtokmk3nki.

# routing
Added basic routes and created all the necessary controllers and views.
I am still wondering how to create login but will learn it tomorrow in a FAQ-session.
Also, update should render the book.view or the user.view, but the form should be prepopulated with existing data. I forgot how to do this, did it once in express already.
Another point would be the 'read' boolean. This is important for the books-view to show the list of read books or the wishlist. A book on the wishlist can be updated to read, but then more fields in the form will be required. Will figure that stuff out when I get there.

Next branch: bookmodel. Creating my books-model and seeds-file from Access-database.

After that high on my list are basic styling, flash-Plastic brain, CRUD-functionality for books, Usermodel, Register-functionality, Login-functionality, the Wishlist-Problem and fun stuff like randomizer, comments-functionality, user statistics (number of books/pages read overall, per month, favorite writer, etc etc).
