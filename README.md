# bookseeder
This took more time than expected, but I finally succeeded in converting my Access2010 database 'Gelezen boeken' to a nice seeder-file.
Had to change all the column-names (no captilas, no spaces, underscores), Toby helped me point that out.
Also found an issue with Turkish chars, so changed the CHARSET from latin1 to utf-8.
Refinement would be to ask for the first name and last name from the author, but that will take some time to adjust my seeds so for now I leave it.
Will tweak the model anyway according to needs along the way, there are more important steps first.
