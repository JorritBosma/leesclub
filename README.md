# skeleton-toby
I need more functionality and will integrate it in this branch.
I want to rebuild my skeleton so I can use the handy functions in MySql for my CRUD-actions.
On the one hand: I lost a lot of time: why not use Toby's skeleton in the first place.
On the other hand: I have a much deeper understanding of the skeleton now which will help me a lot using it and building on it.
