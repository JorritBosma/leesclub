# leesclub
A website to keep track of books you have read and books you want to read.
You can also check out what other users are reading and start a conversation in the comment section.
The wireframe is available at https://octopus.do/yxtokmk3nki.

# routes
Using my wireframe I am setting up the very basic routes in routes.php, in the controllers folder and in the views folder (using placeholder h1's for now).

Later on the available routes will differ on whether you are logged in or not. There will also be two navbars depending on your loggedIn situation.
